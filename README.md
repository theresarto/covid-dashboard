# COVID Dashboard

The COVID Dashboard is an interactive Jupyter Notebook that analyses and visualises COVID-19 data. This project uses Python to fetch, process, and display real-time or historical data trends across various regions. With features like overlay graphs, stacked bar charts, and interactive widgets, users can explore insights into cases, lineages, and their correlation with other metrics such as deaths.

## Key Features:

	•	Visualise COVID-19 case trends across regions over different timeframes.
	•	Analyse lineage data with stacked bar charts showing weekly distributions.
	•	Examine correlations between lineage prevalence and deaths with time-lag analysis.
	•	Fully interactive experience powered by ipywidgets.
